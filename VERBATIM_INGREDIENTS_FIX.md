# Verbatim Ingredient Extraction Fix

## Problem
The ingredient lists were being summarized or paraphrased instead of being extracted exactly as written on the source websites. For example:

**What was returned:**
```
Whole Grain Oats, Sugar, Salt, Natural Flavor, Monk Fruit Extract.
```

**What should have been returned (verbatim from website):**
```
Whole grain oats, chicory root extract, sugar, salt, natural flavor, monk fruit extract.
```

This is a critical issue because:
1. Users need to see the **exact** ingredient list to verify allergens
2. Ingredient matching logic depends on exact wording
3. Legal/safety reasons require verbatim ingredient information

## Solution
Updated all AI prompts with **extremely explicit** instructions to copy ingredient lists character-by-character from source websites.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced Prompt Instructions (All 3 Functions)

Added prominent, detailed instructions with examples:

```
üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR INGREDIENT EXTRACTION:

1. **EXTRACT INGREDIENTS EXACTLY AS WRITTEN - VERBATIM COPY**
   - Copy the ENTIRE ingredient list EXACTLY as it appears on the website
   - Include EVERY single ingredient - do NOT skip, abbreviate, or summarize
   - Preserve ALL punctuation, capitalization, and formatting
   - Include parenthetical information: "Natural Flavor (Contains Milk)" not "Natural Flavor"
   - Include percentages if shown: "Water (70%)" not "Water"
   - Include all sub-ingredients: "Seasoning (Salt, Spices, Garlic Powder)" not "Seasoning"
   - DO NOT paraphrase or reword - copy character-by-character
   - DO NOT use "..." or "etc." - include the complete list
   
   ‚ùå WRONG: "Whole Grain Oats, Sugar, Salt, Natural Flavor"
   ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Whole grain oats, chicory root extract, sugar, salt, natural flavor, monk fruit extract."
```

#### 2. Updated JSON Format Examples

Changed from:
```json
{
  "ingredientsText": "complete ingredient list here"
}
```

To:
```json
{
  "ingredientsText": "EXACT VERBATIM ingredient list - copy character-by-character from the website"
}
```

#### 3. Added Multiple Reminders

Added critical reminders after examples:
```
CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Each "ingredientsText" field MUST be copied EXACTLY, character-by-character from the website
- Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, or abbreviate the ingredient list - copy it verbatim
```

### Expected Behavior

(Complete, verbatim copy with exact capitalization and punctuation)

### Key Improvements

1. ‚úÖ **Explicit "Verbatim Copy" Language** - Uses terms like "character-by-character", "exactly as written"
2. ‚úÖ **Visual Examples** - Shows ‚ùå WRONG vs ‚úÖ CORRECT examples
3. ‚úÖ **Specific Edge Cases** - Covers parentheses, percentages, sub-ingredients
4. ‚úÖ **Multiple Reminders** - Reinforces the requirement throughout the prompt
5. ‚úÖ **Prominent Formatting** - Uses üö® emoji and **bold** to draw attention

### Testing

Visit: **https://clarivore.org/restaurant.html**

Test with the Quaker Oats product (or any product) and verify:
1. ‚úÖ Ingredient lists match **exactly** what's on the source websites
2. ‚úÖ All ingredients are included (no abbreviations or omissions)
3. ‚úÖ Capitalization and punctuation are preserved
4. ‚úÖ Parenthetical information is included
5. ‚úÖ Sub-ingredients are fully listed

### Verification Steps

1. Scan a product
2. Click on a source link (e.g., Walmart)
3. Compare the ingredient list shown in Clarivore with the one on the Walmart page
4. They should match **character-by-character**
